# DaisyUI (with Tailwind CSS)

## What is DaisyUI?

It's not just another UI component library; DaisyUI is a Tailwind CSS plugin. It provides useful component class names to write less code and build faster. It has a lot of UI elements like buttons, inputs, modals, and more. It is a super-powered version of Tailwind. It helps to build beautiful UIs faster without having to leave HTML or custom CSS.
It is about implementing Tailwind CSS even better by giving common UI patterns semantic class names. This doesn't take away any of Tailwind's flexibility for customization. It also comes with themes, which is a bonus.

## How DaisyUI Renders Dynamic Data

DaisyUI on its own does not automatically handle rendering dynamic data. It is just a collection of styles of HTML components. The underlying JavaScript framework like React will handle the logic for dynamic data rendering, such as getting the data, managing state, and updating the UI when the data changes. DaisyUI just gives inputs, displays, and controls their look.

For example, a toggle component from DaisyUI will use React state to keep track of whether it is on or off and send that state as a prop to the DaisyUI component. When the user interacts with the toggle, React's event handlers will update the state, and DaisyUI will reflect that change in the frontend.

## Key Component Types

DaisyUI offers a wide array of components that cover most common UI needs. Some key types relevant to our project include:

- **Buttons:** For actions and interactions.

- **Toggles:** Perfect for boolean properties (on/off states).
- **Range Slider:** Ideal for numerical properties with a defined minimum and maximum (sliders).
- **Input:** Generic text, number, and other input fields.
- **Select:** For enum type properties (dropdowns).
- **Cards:** A versatile component that can serve as the base for our affordance cards.
- **Status:** To show the status of a thing (like if it is Online/Offline).
- **Stat:** Used to show numbers and data in a block.
- **Theme Controller:** To change themes, especially dark/light mode.
- **Progress:** For visualizing levels (like water or bean levels in a coffee machine).
- **Modal:** Useful for action inputs or detailed views.

It also provides excellent styling for form controls, which is super helpful.

## Reusability and Relevance for UI-WoT

DaisyUI, especially when paired with Tailwind CSS, is an **excellent choice** and highly reusable for this UI-WoT project. Here's why:

*   **Foundational UI Building Blocks:** It gives a full set of all basic UI components that can be directly mapped to the fundamental data types and interaction patterns found in Thing Descriptions. For example, we can use DaisyUI's toggle for booleans, range for numbers, select for enums, and input for strings.
*   **Rapid Development:** Pre-styled components and Tailwind's utility-first approach help to build UI quickly, allowing us to focus more on the core logic of TD parsing and dynamic generation.
*   **Customization and Theming:** DaisyUI comes with some default settings, but almost everything about it can be changed with Tailwind. Thus anyone can easily change the look and feel of the dashboard to match any style.
*   **Clean and Minimal:** It encourages a clean and modern aesthetic, which is great for a functional minimal yet catchy dashboard.

## Identified Gaps (and Our Opportunity!)

When seen as a styling framework and a component library it is perfect. But for UI-WoT, DaisyUI does lack in dynamic UI generation from TDs. These are not the limitations of DaisyUI but places where UI-WoT has to extend from it, so currently it lacks:

*   **No Schema-Based UI Generation:** DaisyUI doesn't automatically interpret a JSON Schema to generate a form or best component. DataSchema to the appropriate DaisyUI component.
*   **No Semantic Enrichment:**  It does not understand that a boolean property with `@type` `saref:LightSwitch` should be rendered as a lightbulb icon toggle.
*   **No Dynamic Layout Management:** DaisyUI provides components, but not a system for drag-and-drop layouts or persistence.
